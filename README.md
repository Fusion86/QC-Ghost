# QC-Ghost

Don't bother with the Bethesda Launcher.

![Example](https://i.imgur.com/UT6a9zi.png)


## Features

- [x] Steam Overlay
- [x] Auto Closes the Bethesda Launcher


## How to use

1. Drop QC-Ghost.exe in the same folder as the Bethesda Launcher
2. Add QC-Ghost.exe as a non-steam game in Steam
3. (optional) Change the name in Steam and add the icon
4. Launch the game and have fun


## Good to know

You might have to accept an UAC promt from Windows (you always have to do this, even if you launch it directly from the Bethesda Launcher)

If you fail to start Quake Championship within 20 seconds then QC-Ghost will exit and you won't be 'In a non-steam game' anymore.
